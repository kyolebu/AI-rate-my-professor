The store was always electric, although others may say crazy.  I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.  \\r\n\\r\nThe managers were all great and they were never above doing what they asked of their employees. \\r\n\\r\nThe benefits and pay were amazing for a part time job.  \\r\n\\r\nWorking for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever.  \\r\n\\r\nThis is a job I truly miss and I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given!"

You are being monitored majority of your shift and it can get a bit annoying for someone like me. All in all not too bad but I don’t think it is much longevity. "
