This place is amazing if you are \"in the fold\" and good at tactical execution and fire-fighting.\n\nThe downside: Special projects are given to the same people over and over again. This creates a cycle of inequity, where the same people receive the EE or GE ratings (and promos) because of their additional impact. On the flip side, highly capable individuals who did an amazing job are often given MA ratings because their additional impact didn't measure up to the perception of the special projects. Additionally, \"you are responsible for creating opportunities to deliver impact\", but in truth, most of the super impactful opportunities are selectively assigned and rewarded.\n\nOn the tactical execution comment, my advice is to play the short game and be good at fire-fighting. Anything truly strategic is unlikely to be valued and is never rewarded as much as putting out a good old fashioned dumpster fire."

The company fosters a dynamic, fast-paced environment where innovation and collaboration are at the forefront. The opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects with some of the brightest minds in the industry was a highlight. Meta values employee growth, offering ample resources for professional development and career advancement. The culture promotes open communication, and leadership is supportive, encouraging creativity and problem-solving. However, the high expectations and rapid pace can be challenging, requiring strong time management and adaptability. Overall, Meta is an excellent place for those who thrive in a challenging, technology-driven environment and are passionate about making an impact on a global scale."

While the team was talented and there were opportunities to learn, the company's focus seemed heavily weighted towards performance metrics and less on individual growth. The workload was often intense, with tight deadlines and high expectations, which sometimes made it challenging to maintain a work-life balance. Communication across teams could be improved, as it often felt like information was siloed. Overall, it was a learning experience, but the work culture didn't align well with my career goals or work style."
