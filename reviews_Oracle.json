They do paid  training for 8 weeks on sales and product knowledge, and you get to build a huge and strong network of professionals who recently graduated college... feels very much like college/family vibe during training.\n\nThe downside is that the sales work is very much grunt work e.g. 250 calls and emails per week and you're also responsible for researching the company, building a blueprint on their current state, researching who to call and tracking down their contact info for 10 different accounts at a time while logging them correctly so management can give credit for your work and you can end up working long hours of unpaid overtime. medical benefits are good but there's basically no PTO in the first year (they give 6 days but make you take it while their offices are closed for Christmas)\n\nif you're a hustler who loves sales and wants to make a name for yourself in corporate America, this could be for you. If you're trying to get paid and maybe meet some people, maybe develop your resume... I'd consider looking elsewhere!"
