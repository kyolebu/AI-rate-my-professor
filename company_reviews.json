        "reviewPros": "Not bad pay and they give you paid time off. Not much but I think last time I work there they give you like 2-3 paid days off. I did have a cool manager named Brandon. He was really understanding and would stand up for me if anyone tried to get on me for taking too long in the bathroom cause my time off task or whatever they call it was like 5-10 mins and the reason it was even that long was because its hard to find a bathroom in the warehouse I worked in.",
        "reviewCons": "Barely any paid time off, you won't have much of a social life and your life will only be working for them and not getting time to hang out with friends, so not trying to be mean but if you don't have many friends and are fine working so hard that you pass out by the time you get food and eat and settle down then this job for you. If you do have a life with lots of friends and family. I'd suggest trying something else unless you are desperate for money. As they will boot you out if you get injured, lose your car. Anything bad that happens they don't care. You've become a burden and they just throw you out like garbage. Take it from someone they work so hard I pretty much messed my left arm up and they threw me out like garbage. The only reason I even did the job was because I was desperate for $$$$."

        "reviewPros": "One of the best reasons to work at Amazon is the opportunity for educational advancement. After three months of employment, Amazon will pay for you to pursue higher education. For example, right now they are covering the cost of my Full Stack Software Engineer class. Additionally, Amazon offers competitive pay and a comprehensive benefits package, including health, dental, and vision insurance, as well as retirement plans. You also have full control over your work schedule, providing flexibility to balance work and personal commitments. The fast-paced environment and job stability are other significant advantages, along with opportunities for career growth for those who perform well and are willing to take on additional responsibilities. While the work can be physically demanding, the supportive benefits and opportunities for advancement make it a rewarding experience.",
        "reviewCons": "The cons include the management in place. Most have subpar social skills, and upper management has no idea what is happening on the floor. They stay behind their desks only looking at the numbers. They say they care about safety, but if you look at the rate we are supposed to work at, you'll see what they care about the most. I really think Amazon should require every new manager to read \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" and pass a test on it before starting their role. On the corporate side of things, the pay could always be better. In California, the cost of living is so high, and the pay they offer is by no means a job you can retire from, which is why I am taking classes to upgrade my skills and increase my pay. Adding to this, many employees find the work environment to be highly stressful due to strict productivity targets and physically demanding tasks. The work-life balance can be challenging with long hours and mandatory overtime during peak seasons. Despite opportunities for advancement, some employees feel that management does not always support career development. Inconsistent management practices can also lead to a lack of clear communication and support. Additionally, while benefits are comprehensive, the demanding nature of the job often overshadows these positives, leading to a high turnover rate and general dissatisfaction among staff."

But workers' comp is for things like breaking a bone, or at least my joints are 100%, everyone has joint pain, I'm a big baby, etc, it's just that all of mine started after my first peak season. Anyway, I found the worker's comp/accommodation process kinda humiliating and I felt like a bad person for trying to attempt it.

People leave the company, and their work gets absorbed by others instead of leaders backfilling roles, even when backfill is needed. Major downward pressure on career advancement via politics of turn-taking and strict performance review process. Leads to constant judgment of whether people are performing tasks \"appropriately for their level.\" Contributes to people overworking themselves out of fear. Scarcity of time across the organization makes some teams territorial and protective of their minutes."

Over worked - certain team members were placed with high expectations such as competing \"x\" amount of cases, investigations, etc. by a certain time. If you did not meet their expectations, they would let you go. Poor communication - management never knew how to to communicate with their team. Management would ask for feedback, and they would only improve for a week and go back to their old habits. Management would not take accountability for their actions, and point the finger at their team behind their teams back. Poor management - monthly 1:1s with managers were not helpful because managers did not know how to offer feedback. Manager would say that you're not meeting weekly goals without first understanding the difference of the amount of work amongst each shifts. Manager would not know what you accomplish because they do not work on your shift. The team was always the last ones to find out what was going on with the site because the manager did not pass the information over or ensure all shifts of the team were aware. Performance based - you are expected to innovate and come up with projects. It's fun at first until your performance and 1:1s are reviewed by it. You are constantly compared to your peers. Managers do not understand the policies themselves, and hate to admit their wrong. Poor work life balance - schedules change every 6mo, and you are rotated among different shifts. There isn't an accommodation policy for salaried employees so they use that against you. No accommodation for school - they might be able to accommodate at first, but they always go back on their word. You will not be able to work less hours once you are salaried unless you have a medical accommodation, only exception."

        "reviewCons": "- While it can be laid-back, you need to be familiar with your specific warehouse to reach that point - Not many opportunities for growth - only one role above unless you switch to management - While pay is good, you'll find other less technical roles skyrocket past you in pay structure. This job's pay structure is a messed up combo of L3 and L4 pay, meaning you get none of the benefits of review-based pay but all of the negatives. - One of these negatives is PIPs - maintenance techs that make more than you cannot be placed on a performance improvement plan (i.e fired for various \"performance based reasons\"), while you can. - You also won't get the raises technicians get... while you see them get $2-$7 dollars every few years, you might see $2 AT MOST in the same time. That's also assuming it isn't your first year (if the performance review is 11.99 months from your start date - no raise, sorry!). That's even if you get the highest performance rating. - Prepare for everyone to push every problem onto you since they don't understand what you do, then get mad when you don't do their job for them In summary for Pros and Cons - Good pay and job security if you don't mind staying in the same underappreciated position forever, just know you'll be overlooked in the giant corporate machine when it comes to your career development. Instead, skip an apprenticeship/schooling and just do their MRA program. You'll get better pay, short and free schooling, free travel, and better job security since that role is respected much more by the company than any other RME role. Either that, or go ahead and do CST->CSL... but be warned, it's probably the highest you'll go at Amazon."

Terrible hours, working 13 hours a day 3-4 times a week. 5AM-6PM or 5PM-6AM are the currently shift times if you would like to become a manager. It did not used to be like this, so I have given up on my goal to become a manager because the currently schedule is not great in my opinion. This will causes Managers to quit and not be able to talk to all amazonians which leads to connection scores going down along with morale for team. The pay is average, I think amazon should pay Tier 1 AAs more. Tier 3's should be paid more, and Managers should be paid more. I expected more from a company this huge but in reality the money is not equally distributed across the positions for what we are doing. Certain positions should be paid more for what they require you to know. Yet Amazon loves to generalize everything."

I have seen the exact same flaws, errors, and issues with last mile between the stations and the drivers for years. Known issues are simply neglected issues with this company and the entire process seems like an ongoing Beta version of what it could be. Imagine the money saved by stations AND DSP owners by simply fixing minor Flex app issues that have plagued drivers for years. Investing millions in automation but still having the same issues with properly loading routes. It's truly mind blowing how disassociated the company is with the actual process that makes them a company."
